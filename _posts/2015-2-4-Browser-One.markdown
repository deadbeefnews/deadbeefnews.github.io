Redmond, Washington. Today, the tech giant Microsoft has confirmed they will be rebranding their infamous Internet Explorer to simply be called “Browser One.”

“People are using the browser to do way more than ever.” Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella stated. “Instead of having multiple browsers to drive competition, we really ought to have one browser that determines the standards.  Besides, most people don’t even know what a browser is.” Nadella claims.  “The abundant choices for users are overwhelming – sometimes scary.  And we care about our users.  We don’t want them to get Scroogled.”

Rumors have it that Browser One will do away with Javascript. “None of the browsers can implement Javascript correctly.” Nadella states.  “So, we decided to continue the scripting language to be true and tested – VBScript.”

The biggest innovation from Browser One will be native support for watching TV (specifically sports) and playing Call of Duty.  “The browser is about to become the next water cooler!” Nadella excitingly concludes.
