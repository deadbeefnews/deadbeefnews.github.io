Amazon Fresh stated last week that they will be throttling the delivery of food products to Comcast employees amid distribution conflicts with their suppliers.

"We're just trying to make things more fair for us." Says Sam Alerto, head of Amazon Fresh Delivery division. "These products think they can get a free ride on our delivery service. We have to pay the money for the trucks and warehouses and the product producers don't pay us a dime!"

We decided to ask a product supplier for their viewpoint on the fiasco. General Mills stated "We'd be willing to connect our cereal delivery directly to Amazon's warehouse but they insist on buying our product through third party distributors. The distributors are overburdened and don't have enough delivery systems to meet demand to Amazon."

Speaking with Comcast employee customers, the overwhelming complaint is that they just want their food without priority. As to why they were singled out, we were told by Amazon Fresh that Comcast Employees consume twelve times as much food bandwidth as an average customer.

The Federal Trade Commission has stated they are reviewing the matter and are considering regulating food delivery services as hazardous waste so that they may be able to control such supply problems.
